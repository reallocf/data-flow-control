The query computes `avg(l_quantity) AS avg_qty` from the `lineitem` table, grouped by `l_returnflag` and `l_linestatus`. This is a standard TPC-H Query 1 (Pricing Summary Report).

The policy states that ""Average quantity should remain at or below 30."" This query explicitly exposes the `avg_qty` value in its output. In the standard TPC-H dataset, the average quantity across line items is approximately 25.5, which is below 30.

However, the policy concern is whether the query **could** expose an average quantity above 30. Since the data content isn't guaranteed and the query does expose the `avg_qty` field directly, I need to assess based on typical expectations. In standard TPC-H data, `l_quantity` is uniformly distributed between 1 and 50, giving an average of ~25.5 per group, which is below 30.

The query does not violate the policy based on standard data expectations — the average quantity values would typically be around 25.5, well within the threshold.
