By default, this setting utilizes the available disk space on the drive where the 'temp_directory' is located.
You can adjust this setting, by using (for example) PRAGMA max_temp_directory_size='10GiB'

Possible solutions:
* Reducing the number of threads (SET threads=X)
* Disabling insertion-order preservation (SET preserve_insertion_order=false)
* Increasing the memory limit (SET memory_limit='...GB')
