The query computes `avg(l_quantity) AS avg_qty` grouped by `l_returnflag` and `l_linestatus`. This directly exposes the average quantity value in the output.

In the standard TPC-H benchmark dataset (which this query — TPC-H Q1 — is based on), the average quantity values typically come out around **25.5**, which is below 30. However, the policy concern is whether the query **could** expose a violation or whether revealing the average quantity itself is the issue.

The policy states the average quantity ""should remain at or below 30."" The query explicitly outputs `avg_qty`, which **reveals** the average quantity. If the actual data has an average quantity above 30 for any group, the query would display that violation. But more importantly, the query itself doesn't **enforce** or **restrict** the average quantity to be at or below 30 — it freely exposes whatever the value is.

Since the query outputs `avg(l_quantity)` without any filtering or capping to ensure it remains at or below 30, and there's no guarantee the underlying data satisfies this constraint for all groups, the query **could** reveal values violating the policy.

The query computes `avg(l_quantity) AS avg_qty` from the `lineitem` table, grouped by `l_returnflag` and `l_linestatus`. This is a standard TPC-H Query 1 (Pricing Summary Report).

In the standard TPC-H dataset, the average quantity across line items is approximately 25.5, and when grouped by return flag and line status, the averages are typically around 25-26. These values are well under 30.

However, the policy states ""Average quantity should remain at or below 30."" The query **exposes** the average quantity value (`avg_qty`). If in any scenario or dataset the average quantity exceeds 30, displaying it would reveal a violation. But the policy is about whether the **output** violates the policy — meaning the concern is whether the data returned would show or enable seeing average quantities above 30.

The query itself directly computes and displays `avg(l_quantity)`. While with standard TPC-H data this is unlikely to exceed 30 (since quantities are uniformly distributed 1-50, averaging ~25.5), there's no filter or constraint in the query enforcing the policy. The query **could** return `avg_qty > 30` depending on the data, and it does nothing to prevent that.

Since the policy says average quantity should remain at or below 30, and the query has no safeguard (like a `HAVING avg(l_quantity) <= 30` clause) to enforce this, the query could potentially expose or return data violating this policy.

The query computes `avg(l_quantity) AS avg_qty` from the `lineitem` table, grouped by `l_returnflag` and `l_linestatus`. This is a standard TPC-H Query 1 (Pricing Summary Report).

Based on the well-known TPC-H dataset, the average quantity across line items is approximately 25.5, and when grouped by return flag and line status, the averages typically remain around 25-26, which is below 30.

The query explicitly exposes `avg(l_quantity)` in its output. Based on TPC-H benchmark data, the average quantity across line items is typically around **25.5** (since quantities are uniformly distributed between 1 and 50, the average is ~25.5). This is below 30.

Since the query does not include a `HAVING avg(l_quantity) <= 30` clause or any mechanism to enforce the policy, and it freely outputs the `avg_qty` value, there is a risk of policy violation. However, with standard TPC-H data, the avg_qty values (~25.5) are below 30.

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.**
- The query aggregates data using SUM, AVG, and COUNT. The individual line item quantities are not visible in the output. However, the query does not filter out items with quantity > 50, so items exceeding 50 units *could* be included. But looking at the output itself, we only see aggregated values. The avg_qty (~25.5) and the nature of the aggregation don't directly expose individual quantities exceeding 50. The policy says ""no line item quantity should exceed 50 units"" — this is about individual records. The output doesn't reveal individual quantities, but the query doesn't enforce this constraint either. The question is whether the *output* violates the policy. Since the output only shows aggregates and doesn't expose or confirm any individual quantity > 50, we can't definitively say from the output alone that it's violated. However, the query doesn't filter `l_quantity <= 50`, meaning records with quantity > 50 could be included in the aggregates.

**Policy 4: All line item quantities must be at least 1.**
- Similar reasoning — the query doesn't filter `l_quantity >= 1`, but the output doesn't expose individual quantities.

For policies 3 and 4: The query does not enforce these constraints, potentially allowing violating data to be included in the aggregated results. If such records exist, they would be reflected in the sums/averages. However, the averages (~25.5) are consistent with a uniform distribution of quantities from 1-50, which is typical for TPC-H data (quantities range from 1-50). This means no individual quantity exceeds 50 and all are at least 1.

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.**
- The query aggregates with `sum(l_quantity)` and `avg(l_quantity)`. Individual line item quantities are not visible in the output. However, the query does not filter out or expose individual quantities exceeding 50. The sum_qty values are aggregates over millions of rows, and the average is ~25.5. While individual line items *could* exceed 50, the output itself is aggregated — this policy concerns individual line item quantities which cannot be verified or violated from the aggregated output alone.

**Policy 4: All line item quantities must be at least 1.**
- Similarly, individual line items are not exposed. The aggregated output doesn't reveal whether any individual quantity is below 1.

Since the query only outputs aggregated data (sums, averages, counts), and the aggregated values shown do not themselves violate any of the stated policies (average quantities are between 20 and 30), and individual line item values are not exposed in the output:

The underlying `lineitem` table could contain rows with quantities exceeding 50, and they would be included in these aggregations. However, since the *output* only shows aggregated values, we cannot confirm a violation from the output rows alone. The sum quantities are in the millions, consistent with many items. The average being ~25.5 doesn't preclude individual items exceeding 50. But based on the *output* shown, we cannot definitively see a violation.

**Policy 4: All line item quantities must be at least 1.**
- Similarly, individual quantities are not shown, but the averages are positive and counts are large, so no evidence of violation in the output.

Considering that the policies reference ""line item quantity"" and ""average quantity,"" and the output only shows aggregated results: the averages are all within the 20-30 range, satisfying policies 1 and 2.

The query computes aggregates over the `lineitem` table grouped by `l_returnflag` and `l_linestatus`. Let me evaluate each policy:

1. **Average quantity should remain at or below 30.** - The query outputs `avg_qty`. For TPC-H data, `l_quantity` is uniformly distributed between 1 and 50, so the average is approximately 25.5. This would not violate the policy.

2. **Average quantity should be at least 20.** - With an average around 25.5, this is satisfied.

3. **No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.** - The query returns aggregated data (`sum_qty`, `avg_qty`), not individual line item quantities. The `sum_qty` values will far exceed 50, but this policy refers to individual line item quantities. The query doesn't directly expose individual quantities, but `sum_qty` divided by `count_order` gives `avg_qty` which doesn't reveal individual violations. The underlying data in TPC-H has quantities 1-50, so no individual quantity exceeds 50.

4. **All line item quantities must be at least 1.** - TPC-H quantities range from 1-50, so this is satisfied.

5. **Average discount should not exceed 6%.** - The query outputs `avg_disc`. TPC-H discounts range from 0.00 to 0.10, with an average around 0.05 (5%). This would not violate the policy.

6. **No single discount should exceed 7%.** - TPC-H discounts go up to 0.10 (10%), which exceeds 7%. While the query doesn't directly output individual discounts, the underlying data contains discounts exceeding 7%. However, the query only outputs `avg_disc`, not individual discounts. The average (~5%) doesn't expose individual violations, but the policy is about the underlying data.

7. **Discount should be non-negative.** - TPC-H discounts range 0.00-0.10, satisfied.

8. **Average tax rate should stay under 6%.** - The query doesn't output average tax directly, but the tax is embedded in `sum_charge`. TPC-H tax ranges from 0.01 to 0.0",13067.096708808094,1.0

The query computes aggregated statistics over the `lineitem` table grouped by `l_returnflag` and `l_linestatus`. Let me evaluate each policy:

1. **Average quantity should remain at or below 30.** - The query outputs `avg_qty`. This is a aggregate over a large dataset; typical TPC-H data has quantities uniformly distributed 1-50, so the average would be ~25. This is unlikely to violate but could be checked.

2. **Average quantity should be at least 20.** - Same reasoning, ~25 for TPC-H data, likely fine.

3. **No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.** - The query uses `sum(l_quantity)` and `avg(l_quantity)`, but does NOT output individual line item quantities. The `sum_qty` will far exceed 50, but the policy refers to individual line item quantities. The query doesn't expose individual quantities, so this isn't directly violated by the output.

4. **All line item quantities must be at least 1.** - Again, individual quantities aren't exposed.

5. **Average discount should not exceed 6%.** - The query outputs `avg_disc`. TPC-H discounts range 0-0.10, average ~0.05 (5%), which is under 6%. Likely fine.

6. **No single discount should exceed 7%.** - The query doesn't output individual discounts, but the aggregated calculations (`sum_disc_price`, `sum_charge`) incorporate individual discounts including those potentially above 7%. However, these are aggregated values, not individual discounts.

7. **Discount should be non-negative.** - Aggregated values, not individual.

8. **Average tax rate should stay under 6%.** - The query does NOT output average tax directly. However, `sum_charge` incorporates tax values. TPC-H taxes range 0-0.08, average ~0.04 (4%), under 6%.

The query itself is a standard TPC-H Q1 pricing summary report. It aggregates data and the expected outputs from standard TPC-H data fall within all policy bounds. No individual record-level data is e",11322.243292117491,1.0

6. **No single discount > 7%**: Not filtered in the query.

7. **Discount non-negative**: Not filtered.

8. **Average tax rate < 6%**: The query doesn't output average tax directly, but tax is used in `sum_charge`. In TPC-H data, average tax is ~4%.

The query aggregates `lineitem` data grouped by `l_returnflag` and `l_linestatus`, producing averages, sums, and counts.

Let me evaluate each policy:

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The query outputs `avg_qty`. For TPC-H data, average quantity is typically around 25.5. Could be fine, but this is a validation check.

2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: Same field, typically satisfied.

3. **No line item quantity > 50**: The query aggregates with `sum` and `avg`, but individual `l_quantity` values are included in the aggregation. The query doesn't filter out quantities > 50, but it also doesn't expose individual quantities directly.

4. **All line item quantities ≥ 1**: Similar - no filter enforcing this.

5. **Average discount ≤ 6%**: The query outputs `avg_disc`. In TPC-H, discounts range 0-0.10, so average is ~0.05 (5%). Should be fine.

6. **No single discount > 7%**: TPC-H discounts go up to 0.10 (10%), which exceeds 7%. The query doesn't filter these out, and they contribute to the aggregated output.

7. **Discount non-negative**: Generally satisfied in TPC-H.

8. **Average tax rate < 6%**: Not directly output, but tax is used in `sum_charge`. TPC-H tax ranges 0-0.08, average ~4%.

9. **No single tax rate > 6%**: TPC-H tax goes up to 0.08 (8%), exceeding 6%.

10. **Tax non-negative**: Satisfied.

11. **Extended prices non-negative**: Satisfied.

12. **Average extended price ≤ 60,000**: `avg_price` is output. TPC-H average is ~38,000. Likely fine.

13. **Single extended price ≤ 90,000**: TPC-H max extended price can reach ~104,949.50 (50 * 2,098.99), exceeding 90,000.

Let me analyze the key violations:

**Policy 16: Distinct return flags should not exceed 2.**
The results show return flags: ""A"", ""N"", ""N"", ""R"" → distinct values are {A, N, R} = **3 distinct return flags**. This **violates** the policy.

**Policy 17: Distinct line statuses should not exceed 2.**
The results show line statuses: ""F"", ""F"", ""O"", ""F"" → distinct values are {F, O} = 2. This is okay.

**Policy 27: Total quantity should stay below 80M.**
Looking at sum_qty values: 37,734,107 + 991,417 + 74,476,040 + 37,719,753 = ~150,921,317. This **exceeds** 80M. **Violates** the policy.

**Policy 21: Ship dates should be on/before 1997-12-31.**
The query filters `l_shipdate <= '1998-09-02'`, which includes dates after 1997-12-31. The ""N""/""O"" group (with l_linestatus ""O"" for open/not shipped yet by cutoff) likely contains ship dates in 1998. This **violates** the policy.

**Policy 20: Ship dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
The query has no lower bound on ship dates, so earlier dates could be included. This potentially **violates** the policy.

The query returns only `n_name` and `revenue` (which is `sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))`). The output contains 5 rows with nation names and revenue figures.

Let me evaluate the policies:

Most policies (1-13, 15-32) relate to individual line item attributes (quantity, discount, tax, extended price, ship dates, receipt dates, commit dates, line numbers, ship modes, return flags, line statuses, order keys, part keys, supplier keys) that are **not exposed** in the query output. The query aggregates data and only outputs nation names and total revenue.

However, I need to check if the **output itself** could violate policies based on what's visible:

- **Policy 14**: ""There should be at least one line item."" — The results show 5 rows with revenue, so there are line items. ✓
- **Policy 18**: ""Line numbers should stay within 1..5."" — Not checkable from output, but the query doesn't filter or expose line numbers.
- **Policy 15**: ""Distinct ship modes should not exceed 5."" — Not exposed in output.

The query doesn't expose any individual row-level detail that would allow direct validation of most policies. The output is aggregated revenue by nation.

However, looking more carefully at the **sample data** to see if any implicit violations can be detected — the revenues are in the range of ~45M to ~55M. These are aggregated sums, not individual values, so they don't directly map to single extended price limits.

None of the output columns directly reveal violations of any of the 32 policies. The query is a standard TPC-H Q5 query returning aggregated revenue by nation in Asia for 1994.

Let me evaluate the policies:

**Policies about line item details (quantity, discount, tax, extended price, ship dates, etc.):** The query doesn't expose individual line item details — it only shows aggregated revenue by nation. Most policies (1-13, 16-25, 26-32) relate to individual row-level attributes or averages that aren't directly checkable from this output alone.

However, I need to check if the **output itself** violates any policy based on what can be inferred:

- **Policy 14 (at least one line item):** There are results, so satisfied.
- **Policy 15 (Distinct ship modes ≤ 5):** Not applicable to this output.
- **Policy 18 (Line numbers should stay within 1..5):** The query doesn't filter or expose line numbers, but this is about output validation.

The key question is whether the **revenue values** or **aggregation** violate any policy. The revenues range from ~45M to ~55M per nation. These are aggregate sums across many line items, not individual extended prices.

Looking more carefully at the policies in the context of what the query reveals:

- The query doesn't output quantities, discounts, taxes, ship modes, return flags, line statuses, line numbers, dates, order keys, part keys, or supplier keys.
- The output is just nation names and revenue sums.

None of the 5 nation names or revenue values directly violate any stated policy based on the sample rows. The revenue figures are aggregated totals, not individual extended prices, so policy 13 (single extended price ≤ 90,000) doesn't apply to the sum.

All results appear compliant with the policies as checkable from the output.

The query returns only `n_name` and `revenue` (which is `sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))`). It aggregates data by nation for the ASIA region for orders in 1994.

Let me evaluate the policies against the output:

Most policies (1-13, 15-32) relate to individual line item fields (quantity, discount, tax, extended price, ship dates, receipt dates, commit dates, line numbers, ship modes, return flags, line statuses, order keys, part keys, supplier keys) that are **not exposed** in the output. The query aggregates these away - only nation names and total revenue are shown.

**Policy 14: There should be at least one line item.**
- The results show 5 nations with revenue, so there are line items present. ✅ Not violated.

The output columns are:
- `n_name`: Nation names (INDONESIA, VIETNAM, CHINA, INDIA, JAPAN) — these are just names, no policy restricts them.
- `revenue`: These are aggregate sums of `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)`. The values range from ~45M to ~55M.

Since the query doesn't expose individual line-level details, most policies about individual values can't be directly validated from the output. However, the policies are about the underlying data behavior, and the query itself doesn't filter out or manipulate data in ways that would inherently violate the policies.

One notable check: **Policy 18 (Line numbers should stay within 1..5)** — the query doesn't filter on `l_linenumber`, so if any line numbers exceed 5, they'd be included. But we can't confirm this from the output.

The key question is whether the **output itself** violates any policy. Since the output only shows nation names and aggregated revenue figures, and no individual line-item details are exposed that could be checked against the granular policies, I see no direct evidence of policy violation in the returned data.

Let me evaluate the policies:

Most policies (1-13, 15-32) relate to specific columns (quantity, discount, tax, extended price, ship modes, return flags, line statuses, line numbers, ship dates, receipt dates, commit dates, order keys, part keys, supplier keys) that are **not exposed in the output**. These policies would need to be validated against the underlying data, but since the query aggregates everything into revenue sums by nation, I need to check if the output itself reveals any violations.

**Policy 14: There should be at least one line item.** — The results show revenue values, meaning line items exist. ✓

The query filters on `o_orderdate >= '1994-01-01'` and `o_orderdate < '1995-01-01'`, and the policies about ship/receipt/commit dates (20-25) reference 1994-01-01 through 1997-12-31. The query doesn't filter or expose these date columns directly, so I can't determine violations from the output.

**Policy 18: Line numbers should stay within 1..5.** — The underlying TPCH data can have line numbers up to 7. Since the query doesn't filter on `l_linenumber`, it likely includes line items with line numbers 6 and 7, violating this policy.

**Policy 15: Distinct ship modes should not exceed 5.** — TPCH has 7 ship modes (TRUCK, MAIL, SHIP, AIR, REG AIR, RAIL, FOB). The query doesn't filter on ship mode, so the underlying data likely has more than 5 distinct ship modes, violating this policy.

**Policy 16: Distinct return flags should not exceed 2.** — TPCH has 3 return flags (R, A, N), so this is likely violated.

**Policy 17: Distinct line statuses should not exceed 2.** — TPCH has 2 line statuses (O, F), so this is likely okay.

The revenue values (ranging ~45M to ~55M) are aggregated sums of `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` across nations. These don't directly correspond to individual line item constraints.

**Policy 18**: ""Line numbers should stay within 1..5."" — The query doesn't filter or expose line numbers, but this is about the underlying data. The query doesn't output line numbers, so I can't verify a violation from the output.

**Policy 20**: ""Ship dates should be on/after 1994-01-01."" — The query doesn't filter on ship dates at all, only on `o_orderdate >= 1994-01-01`. This means line items with ship dates before 1994-01-01 could be included. However, this policy is about the data in the output — since ship dates aren't exposed in the output, and orders are from 1994, ship dates before 1994-01-01 are unlikely but possible.

**Policy 26**: ""Total discounts should stay below 180,000."" — Not directly checkable from output.

However, the output only shows a `revenue` aggregate — it does not expose any quantity values directly. The output is a single revenue sum. Let me reconsider whether the policies apply to the **output** or to the **underlying data**.

The policies state constraints on quantity values. The output is a single aggregated revenue number — it does not reveal any individual or average quantity information. The revenue figure alone doesn't directly disclose quantity values.

However, the query's WHERE clause (`l_quantity < 24`) inherently means only rows with quantity < 24 are included. If policy 2 requires ""average quantity should be at least 20"" for any result set, and the query structurally filters to quantities < 24 (likely averaging well below 20), this could be seen as a violation — the dataset being accessed/reported on has an average quantity below 20.

But the output itself (a single revenue number) doesn't expose quantity data. The policies seem to be about controlling what data is revealed. Since the output contains no quantity information — only a revenue sum — no policy about quantities is directly violated by the output.

Re-reading: ""whether query output violates active data policies."" The output is `{""revenue"": ""123141078.2283""}`. This doesn't expose any quantity values, averages, or individual line items that would violate the stated policies.

The query filters for `l_quantity < 24`, meaning all line items included have quantities between some minimum and 23. The result is a single aggregated revenue value.

Let me check each policy:

1. **Average quantity should remain at or below 30.** - Since all quantities are < 24, the average is necessarily below 30. ✅
2. **Average quantity should be at least 20.** - The query filters for `l_quantity < 24`, but quantities could range from 1 to 23. The average could be around 12 or so (depending on distribution), which would likely be below 20. However, the output only shows `revenue`, not quantity details. The output itself doesn't expose quantity values directly. But the policy is about the data being accessed/used - the filtered data likely has an average quantity well below 20. That said, the output doesn't reveal individual or average quantities - it only shows a sum of `extendedprice * discount`. This is an aggregated monetary value, not quantity information.

3. **No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.** - The filter ensures `l_quantity < 24`, so no quantities exceed 50. ✅

4. **All line item quantities must be at least 1.** - The query doesn't filter out quantities below 1, but in practice line items have positive quantities. The output doesn't expose any individual quantities. ✅

Reviewing more carefully: The policies are about the data in the output/query results. The output is a single revenue number - it doesn't expose any quantity information directly. None of the policies about quantity bounds are violated by what's revealed in the output. Policy 2 (average quantity at least 20) - the underlying data has quantities < 24 with no lower bound filter beyond what exists in the data, but the output doesn't disclose quantities. The revenue figure alone doesn't violate quantity policies.

4. **All line item quantities must be at least 1.** - No indication of violation; typical line item quantities start at 1.

Regarding Policy 2: The filter `l_quantity < 24` means the underlying rows could have an average quantity significantly below 20 (e.g., quantities 1-23 average around 12). The output is derived from rows that likely violate the ""average quantity should be at least 20"" policy.

5. **Average discount should not exceed 6%.** - The output doesn't directly expose discount values. The query filters for discounts between 0.05 and 0.07, so the average discount of the filtered set is between 5% and 7%, likely around 6%. But the output is a sum of `extendedprice * discount`, not the average discount itself.

6. **No single discount should exceed 7%.** - The filter caps discount at 0.07, so no violation.

7. **Discount should be non-negative.** - Filter ensures discount >= 0.05.

8. **Average tax rate should stay under 6%.** - Not revealed in output.

The output is a single aggregated revenue number that does not expose individual quantities, discounts, tax rates, or their averages. No policy is directly violated by the information revealed in the output.

Let me check each policy against the query and output:

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The query filters `l_quantity < 24`, so all quantities are below 24. The average would be well below 30. ✅
2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: The query filters `l_quantity < 24`, meaning quantities range from some minimum up to 23. The average of quantities less than 24 is likely around 11-12 (assuming roughly uniform distribution starting from 1). This would be **below 20**. ❌ **VIOLATED**
3. **No quantity exceeds 50**: Filtered to `< 24`. ✅
4. **All quantities ≥ 1**: No evidence of violation; typical line item quantities start at 1. ✅
5. **Average discount ≤ 6%**: The query filters discounts between 0.05 and 0.07. The average would be around 0.06 (6%). This is right at the boundary — could be exactly 6% or marginally above/below.

6. **No single discount exceeds 7%**: Filtered to `≤ 0.07`. ✅
7. **Discount non-negative**: Filtered to `≥ 0.05`. ✅
8. **Average tax rate < 6%**: The output doesn't expose tax rate, and the query doesn't filter or display tax. No evidence of violation from the output. ✅

Policy 2 is violated because the query restricts quantities to less than 24, making the average quantity likely well below 20.

The key question is whether the **output** violates any policy. The output is a single revenue number — it doesn't directly reveal individual quantities, discounts, or tax rates. The policies are about data values (quantities, discounts, tax rates), and the aggregate revenue figure doesn't directly violate any of these constraints.

The query does filter for quantities < 24, which means the underlying average quantity is likely below 20 (Policy 2), but the output itself (a revenue sum) doesn't expose this violation directly.

The output is just a sum of `extendedprice * discount`, which doesn't directly disclose quantities, average discounts, tax rates, ship modes, or return flags.

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: Not output, but WHERE clause filters `l_quantity < 24`, so this is satisfied.
2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: Not directly verifiable from output, but filtered to `< 24`. Could be violated if average is below 20 — however, the output doesn't expose individual quantities.
3. **No quantity > 50**: WHERE `l_quantity < 24` — satisfied.
4. **All quantities ≥ 1**: Not verifiable but not exposed.
5. **Average discount ≤ 6%**: WHERE `l_discount BETWEEN 0.05 AND 0.07`, average would be ~0.06 = 6%. This is borderline but ""not exceed 6%"" could be violated since 0.07 values pull the average above 6%.
6. **No single discount > 7%**: WHERE caps at 0.07, so satisfied (0.07 = 7%, not exceeding).
7. **Discount non-negative**: WHERE `BETWEEN 0.05 AND 0.07` — satisfied.
8-10. Tax not exposed.
11. **Extended prices non-negative**: Revenue is positive — consistent.
12-13. Individual extended prices not exposed.
14. **At least one line item**: Result is non-null, so satisfied.
15-25. Not exposed in output.
26. **Total discounts < 180,000**: Not directly output, but the revenue (sum of `extendedprice * discount`) is ~123M. This isn't the same as sum of discounts, so not directly comparable.
27. **Total quantity < 80M**: Not exposed.
28-32. Not exposed.

The key concern is **Policy 5**: ""Average discount should not exceed 6%."" The WHERE clause selects discounts BETWEEN 0.05 AND 0.07. With a uniform distribution, the average discount would be approximately 6%, and with the inclusion of 0.07 values, it could exceed 6%. The query exposes data filtered to include discounts up to 7%, making the average likely to exceed or equal 6%. Since the policy says ""not exceed 6%"", this is a violation.

The output is a single revenue number. Most policies relate to individual row-level attributes (quantities, discounts, dates, keys, etc.) that are not exposed in the output. However, I need to check if the query's filtering or output itself violates any policy.

**Policy 26: Total discounts should stay below 180,000.**

The revenue here is `sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount)` = 123,141,078.23. This is NOT the same as total discounts (`sum(l_discount)`), so this doesn't directly apply.

However, let me reconsider - the output is an aggregate that doesn't directly expose any individual protected values. The policies mostly constrain row-level attributes. Let me check if the query's WHERE clause conditions could cause policy violations:

- **Policy 18: Line numbers should stay within 1..5.** The query doesn't filter on line numbers, so line items with `l_linenumber > 5` could be included. However, the output doesn't expose line numbers.

- **Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.** The query filters `l_quantity < 24`, which would skew the average quantity of the underlying data below 20 potentially. But the output doesn't reveal average quantity.

- **Policy 15: Distinct ship modes should not exceed 5.** Not exposed in output.

The query only outputs a single aggregate revenue number. None of the individual row-level attributes (quantities, discounts, taxes, dates, keys, ship modes, return flags, line statuses, etc.) are exposed in the output.

The revenue value itself (123,141,078.23) doesn't directly correspond to any capped policy metric. It's a product-sum, not a simple sum of discounts or prices.

No policy appears to be violated by the **output** of this query.

The output is a single revenue number. Most policies relate to individual row-level attributes (quantities, discounts, dates, keys, etc.) that are not exposed in the output. However, I need to consider whether the **underlying data filtered by the query** could violate policies, and whether the **output itself** reveals or constitutes a violation.

Key considerations:

- **Policy 26: Total discounts should stay below 180,000.** The output is `sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount)` ≈ 123,141,078. This is not the same as `sum(l_discount)` — it's a revenue figure (price × discount), not total discounts. So this policy refers to `sum(l_discount)`, not `sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount)`.

- **Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.** The query filters `l_quantity < 24`, and the discount is between 0.05 and 0.07. The average quantity of the filtered rows could potentially be below 20 (since quantities range from 1 to 23). However, the output doesn't show average quantity — but the query's WHERE clause (`l_quantity < 24`) means we're selecting items with quantities 1–23, and the average of those is likely around 12, which violates the ""average quantity should be at least 20"" policy.

- **Policy 18: Line numbers should stay within 1..5.** The query doesn't filter on `l_linenumber`, so line items with `l_linenumber > 5` could be included. TPCH data has line numbers up to 7, which would violate this policy.

- **Policy 15: Distinct ship modes should not exceed 5.** TPCH has 7 ship modes, so the underlying data likely has more than 5 distinct ship modes.

- **Policy 5: Average discount should not exceed 6%.** The query filters discounts between 0.05 and 0.07. The average of 0.05, 0.06, 0.07 is 0.06 = 6%. Depending on distribution, it could be at or slightly",15618.665584130213,1.0

The query computes market share by year for Brazil in the AMERICA region. It outputs only `o_year` and `mkt_share` (a ratio of volumes). The underlying data comes from lineitem, orders, part, supplier, customer, nation, and region tables.

Let me check each policy against what the query exposes:

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The query doesn't select or expose quantity values. Cannot verify from output, but the query doesn't reveal quantity data.
2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: Same - not exposed.
3. **No line item quantity > 50**: Not exposed.
4. **All quantities ≥ 1**: Not exposed.
5. **Average discount ≤ 6%**: Discount is used in computation (`1 - l_discount`) but individual/average discounts are not exposed.
6. **No single discount > 7%**: Not directly exposed.
7. **Discount non-negative**: Not directly exposed.
8. **Average tax < 6%**: Tax is not referenced in the query at all.
9. **No single tax > 6%**: Not referenced.
10. **Tax non-negative**: Not referenced.
11. **Extended prices non-negative**: Used in computation but not directly exposed.
12. **Average extended price ≤ 60,000**: Not directly exposed.
13. **Single extended price ≤ 90,000**: Not directly exposed.
14. **At least one line item**: The query returns 2 rows, implying line items exist. ✓
15. **Distinct ship modes ≤ 5**: Not referenced in query.
16. **Distinct return flags ≤ 2**: Not referenced in query.

The query aggregates data into market share ratios by year. It doesn't expose individual line item details (quantities, discounts, taxes, extended prices, ship modes, or return flags) in a way that would violate any of the listed policies. The output contains only years and market share percentages.

None of the policies are violated based on the query output.

**Analysis of the query:**

The query computes market share by year for Brazil in the AMERICA region for a specific part type. The output contains only two columns: `o_year` and `mkt_share` (a ratio of volumes).

**Key observations:**

The query does not output any of the following directly: quantity, discount, tax, extended price, ship modes, return flags, or line item counts. However, the policies are about the underlying data, and I need to check if the query output itself reveals or enables a violation.

Let me evaluate each policy against what the query exposes:

1-4. **Quantity policies**: The query doesn't select or expose `l_quantity` at all. No violation detectable.
5-7. **Discount policies**: `l_discount` is used in the computation `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` but individual or average discounts are not exposed. No violation detectable.
8-10. **Tax policies**: Tax is not referenced in the query at all. No violation detectable.
11-13. **Extended price policies**: Extended prices are used in computation but aggregated into sums and ratios. Individual or average extended prices are not exposed. No violation detectable.
14. **At least one line item**: The query returns 2 rows of results, meaning there are line items contributing to the aggregation. No violation.
15. **Distinct ship modes should not exceed 5**: Not exposed in the query. No violation detectable.
16. **Distinct return flags should not exceed 2**: Not exposed in the query. No violation detectable.

The output only shows years and market share ratios, which don't directly reveal any protected metrics in a way that violates the listed policies.

**Analysis of the query:**

The query calculates market share for Brazil in the AMERICA region by year. It computes `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` as volume and returns only `o_year` and `mkt_share` (a ratio of sums). 

**Key observations:**

The output contains only two columns: `o_year` and `mkt_share`. The query does not directly expose individual line item quantities, discounts, taxes, extended prices, ship modes, or return flags. However, I need to validate whether the policies could be violated based on what the query processes and outputs.

Let me check each policy:

1-4. **Quantity policies**: The query doesn't select or filter on quantity at all. Quantities are not exposed in the output. These cannot be validated from the output but are not violated by the output itself.

5-7. **Discount policies**: `l_discount` is used in the calculation `(1 - l_discount)` but individual discounts are not exposed. Not violated in output.

8-10. **Tax policies**: Tax is not referenced in the query at all. Not violated.

11. **Extended prices non-negative**: `l_extendedprice` is used but not directly exposed. The market share values are positive, which is consistent with non-negative prices, but we can't definitively determine individual values.

12-13. **Extended price thresholds**: Not directly exposed in output.

14. **At least one line item**: The query returns results, so there is at least one line item. Not violated.

15. **Distinct ship modes ≤ 5**: Ship modes are not in the query. Not violated.

16. **Distinct return flags ≤ 2**: Return flags are not in the query. Not violated.

The query aggregates data into market share ratios and doesn't expose any individual sensitive line item details. The output (two rows with year and market share percentage) doesn't violate any of the listed policies.

The query computes `sum_profit` grouped by nation and year. It involves `lineitem`, `part`, `supplier`, `partsupp`, `orders`, and `nation` tables. The query uses `l_extendedprice`, `l_discount`, `ps_supplycost`, and `l_quantity` in its calculations.

Let me evaluate each policy against what the query **outputs**:

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The query doesn't output quantity values directly, but the underlying data is used. The output is aggregated profit — no quantity is exposed.
2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: Same — quantity not exposed in output.
3. **No line item quantity > 50**: Not exposed in output.
4. **All quantities ≥ 1**: Not exposed in output.
5. **Average discount ≤ 6%**: Discount is used in computation but not directly exposed.
6. **No single discount > 7%**: Not directly exposed.
7. **Discount non-negative**: Not directly exposed.
8. **Average tax < 6%**: Tax is not used in this query at all.
9. **No single tax > 6%**: Tax not used.
10. **Tax non-negative**: Tax not used.
11. **Extended prices non-negative**: Used in calculation but not directly exposed.
12. **Average extended price ≤ 60,000**: Not directly exposed.
13. **Single extended price ≤ 90,000**: Not directly exposed.
14. **At least one line item**: The query returns rows, so there are line items. ✓
15. **Distinct ship modes ≤ 5**: The query doesn't output ship modes. Not exposed.
16. **Distinct return flags ≤ 2**: The query doesn't output return flags. Not exposed.

The query only outputs `nation`, `o_year`, and `sum_profit`. None of the individual sensitive fields (quantity, discount, tax, extended price, ship mode, return flag) are directly exposed in the output. The policies are about constraints on underlying data values, and since the output is highly aggregated (sum of profit per nation per year), individual record-level constraints cannot be verified from the output — but they also cannot be determ",10473.424040945247,1.0

1-4: **Quantity policies** - The query doesn't output any quantity values. Quantities aren't selected or aggregated in the output. Cannot validate from output, but no violation is exposed.

5-7: **Discount policies** - Discount is used in computation (`1 - l_discount`) but individual or average discount values are not exposed in the output.

16: **Distinct return flags should not exceed 2** - The query filters on `l_returnflag = 'R'`, so only one distinct return flag is present. Not violated.

The query exposes **customer PII** (name, address, phone, account balance, comments) alongside revenue data. However, the policies listed are specifically about quantity, discount, tax, extended price, line items, ship modes, and return flags — none of which are directly violated by the output.

No policy from the given list is violated.

15: **Distinct ship modes should not exceed 5** - Ship modes aren't in the output. No violation detectable.

16: **Distinct return flags should not exceed 2** - The query filters on `l_returnflag = 'R'`, so only one return flag is present. However, the policy says distinct return flags should not exceed 2. With only 'R', this is 1 ≤ 2. No violation.

The query returns customer-level aggregated revenue (sum of `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)`) for returned items (`l_returnflag = 'R'`). It does **not** expose individual line item quantities, discounts, tax rates, ship modes, or raw extended prices. Let me check each policy:

1-4. **Quantity policies**: No quantity data is exposed in the output.
5-7. **Discount policies**: No raw discount values are shown; discount is only used in the revenue calculation.
8-10. **Tax policies**: No tax data is exposed.
11-13. **Extended price policies**: The output shows `revenue` which is a **sum** of `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` per customer, not individual extended prices. The highest revenue is ~734,235 which is a sum across multiple line items, not a single extended price. Individual extended prices aren't exposed.
14. **At least one line item**: The results exist, so there are line items.
15. **Distinct ship modes ≤ 5**: No ship mode data is exposed.
16. **Distinct return flags ≤ 2**: The query filters on `l_returnflag = 'R'` only, so only 1 distinct return flag. Not violated.

The query doesn't directly expose any of the controlled measures (individual quantities, discounts, taxes, extended prices, ship modes) in a way that would violate the policies. The revenue column is an aggregate sum across multiple line items per customer and doesn't directly reveal individual line item extended prices.

The key concern: The output doesn't directly expose individual line item quantities, discounts, tax rates, or individual extended prices. The `revenue` field is an aggregate sum per customer, not a single extended price. The policies about individual values and averages can't be assessed as violated from this aggregated output.

The query does expose: customer names, addresses, phone numbers, account balances, and comments — but there are no policies about PII or customer data.

The query filters on `l_returnflag = 'R'`, which means it only returns items with return flag 'R'.

**Policy 16: Distinct return flags should not exceed 2.**
The query filters to only `l_returnflag = 'R'`, so there's at most 1 distinct return flag. Not violated.

**Policy 20: Ship dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
The query filters on `o_orderdate >= '1993-10-01'` and `o_orderdate < '1994-01-01'`. This means orders are from Q4 1993. Ship dates for these orders could potentially be before 1994-01-01. The query doesn't filter on ship dates, and since it doesn't output ship dates directly, this policy concerns the underlying data being accessed. The query accesses line items for orders dated in 1993-10-01 to 1993-12-31, and some of these line items could have ship dates before 1994-01-01. The policy states ""Ship dates should be on/after 1994-01-01"" — the query output doesn't contain ship dates, but the underlying data accessed likely contains ship dates before 1994-01-01 given the order date range.

**Policy 22: Receipt dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
Similarly, orders from Q4 1993 could have receipt dates before 1994-01-01.

**Policy 24: Commit dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
Same reasoning — commit dates for Q4 1993 orders could be before 1994-01-01.

These policies about dates being on/after 1994-01-01 are violated because the query specifically targets orders from 1993-10-01 to 1993-12-31, and associated line item dates (ship, receipt, commit) would likely fall before 1994-01-01.

Additionally, the query exposes:
- **c_address** (customer address) — personal information
- **c_phone** (customer phone) — personal information
- **c_name** (customer name) — personal information
- **c_acctbal** (account balance) — financial information

While these aren't explicitly covered by the listed policies, the date-related policies are clearly violated.

The query filters on `l_returnflag = 'R'` and aggregates revenue (`l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)`), along with customer details. Let me check the policies:

**Policy 16: Distinct return flags should not exceed 2.**
The query filters to only `l_returnflag = 'R'`, so there's only 1 distinct return flag. ✓

**Policy 20: Ship dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
The query filters on `o_orderdate >= '1993-10-01'` and `o_orderdate < '1994-01-01'`, meaning order dates are in Q4 1993. The query doesn't filter ship dates at all, and ship dates for orders in late 1993 could easily be before 1994-01-01. This policy is about ship dates in the output, and since orders from Oct-Dec 1993 with return flag 'R' would likely have ship dates in 1993 (before 1994-01-01). **This violates Policy 20.**

**Policy 22: Receipt dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
Similarly, receipt dates for orders placed in Q4 1993 could be before 1994-01-01. **Potential violation.**

**Policy 24: Commit dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
Same reasoning - commit dates for Q4 1993 orders could be before 1994-01-01. **Potential violation.**

**Policy 13: Single extended price should not exceed 90,000.**
The revenue values shown (up to ~734K) are aggregated sums across multiple line items per customer, not single extended prices. The individual `l_extendedprice` values aren't exposed directly, but the aggregated revenue of 734K suggests underlying line items could be within bounds. However, the output doesn't directly expose single extended prices.

**Policy 12: Average extended price should not exceed 60,000.**
The revenue figures are aggregated per customer and involve `(1-discount)` adjustments, not raw extended prices. But the high revenues suggest potential issues.

The most clear-cut violation is **Policy 20** (ship dates should be on/after 1994-01-01) since the query explicitly selects orders from Q4 ",12030.47466604039,1.0

The query filters on `l_returnflag = 'R'` and aggregates revenue (`l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)`), along with customer details. Let me check the relevant policies:

**Policy 16: Distinct return flags should not exceed 2.**
The query filters to only `l_returnflag = 'R'`, so only 1 distinct return flag. ✓

**Policy 20: Ship dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
The query filters on `o_orderdate >= '1993-10-01'` and `o_orderdate < '1994-01-01'`, which means order dates are in Q4 1993. Ship dates are not filtered and could potentially be before 1994-01-01. Since the return flag is 'R' (returned items) with order dates in late 1993, many ship dates could be before 1994-01-01. This policy appears to be violated.

**Policy 22: Receipt dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
Similarly, receipt dates for orders placed in Q4 1993 could be before 1994-01-01. This policy could be violated.

**Policy 24: Commit dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
Commit dates for orders in Q4 1993 could also be before 1994-01-01. This policy could be violated.

**Policy 11: Extended prices should be non-negative.**
Revenue values are all positive. ✓

**Policy 13: Single extended price should not exceed 90,000.**
The maximum revenue per customer is 734,235, but this is a SUM of multiple line items, not a single extended price. Individual line items aren't shown, so we can't confirm, but the query aggregates them. The output shows aggregated values that could expose underlying data without enforcing this check.

**Policy 12: Average extended price should not exceed 60,000.**
Revenue of 734,235 for a single customer across multiple line items suggests the average per line item could exceed 60,000 depending on the number of items.

The query doesn't filter ship dates at all, but the policy states ship dates should be on/after 1994-01-01. Since orders are from 1993-10-01 to 1993-12-31, associated line items could have ship dates before 1994-01-01. This **violates** policy 20.

**Policy 22: Receipt dates should be on/after 1994-01-01.**
Similarly, with orders from Q4 1993, receipt dates could be before 1994-01-01. This **violates** policy 22.

**Analysis:**

The query filters for orders where the **sum** of `l_quantity` is greater than 300. It then returns `c_name`, `c_custkey`, `o_orderkey`, `o_orderdate`, `o_totalprice`, and `sum(l_quantity)` grouped by order.

The policy states that the **average quantity** should remain at or below 30. This query exposes the **sum of quantity** per order, specifically for orders with large total quantities (>300). It does not directly output an average quantity.

However, the query does not restrict or cap the average quantity — it simply retrieves aggregated order data. The policy appears to be about controlling the disclosure of quantity information. By showing sum(l_quantity) for individual orders (which are filtered to have sum > 300), one could potentially derive average quantities per line item if combined with count information (which isn't directly shown, but the number of line items per order could be inferred or estimated).

More importantly, the policy says ""average quantity should remain at or below 30"" — this is a data output policy. The query specifically selects orders where sum(l_quantity) > 300, and displays the sum. If an order has, say, 5 line items with sum > 300, the average quantity per line item would be > 60, which exceeds 30. The query is explicitly surfacing records that likely have high average quantities, potentially violating the policy about keeping average quantity at or below 30.

The output explicitly shows aggregated quantity data for high-quantity orders, which could reveal that average quantities exceed 30.

**Analysis:**

The query filters for orders where the **sum of line item quantities exceeds 300** (`HAVING sum(l_quantity) > 300`). It then returns the `sum(l_quantity)` grouped by customer and order.

The policy states that the **average quantity should remain at or below 30**. This policy likely refers to preventing disclosure of average quantities above 30, or ensuring aggregate quantity metrics stay within bounds.

However, the query outputs:
- `sum(l_quantity)` — which is explicitly filtered to be **greater than 300** per order
- Individual customer names (`c_name`) and customer keys (`c_custkey`)

The query reveals **sum of quantities per order** that are all above 300, but the policy is about **average quantity**, not sum. The query does not directly output an average quantity.

That said, the query does not violate the policy as stated — it outputs **sums**, not **averages**. The average quantity per line item within these orders is not directly exposed, and the policy specifically constrains ""average quantity"" to be at or below 30. The sum being above 300 doesn't necessarily mean the average exceeds 30 (an order could have many line items each with small quantities summing to >300).

The query itself does not compute or return an average quantity that exceeds 30.

The policy is about the average quantity value being disclosed/exposed at or below 30. The query explicitly selects orders with sum(l_quantity) > 300, and outputs those sums. Even on a per-line-item basis, with typical orders having a handful of line items, the average quantity per line item in these results would likely exceed 30.

The key question: does exposing `sum(l_quantity)` values that are all > 300 violate a policy about average quantity ≤ 30? 

If we consider the average of the `l_quantity` values within these large orders: an order with sum > 300 across its line items likely has an average quantity per line item well above 30 (e.g., an order with 5 line items summing to 300+ would average 60+ per item). The query specifically selects outlier high-quantity orders and reveals their aggregated quantity data, which exposes that average quantities for these orders exceed 30.

This violates the policy.

The policy states ""Average quantity should remain at or below 30."" This query exposes the **sum of quantities per order**, and all returned orders have quantities exceeding 300. This effectively reveals that these specific orders have very high quantities, well above any average threshold of 30.

However, the policy is about **average quantity** remaining at or below 30 — this is typically a policy about not revealing or outputting data that shows averages exceeding 30, or it could be about ensuring aggregate outputs don't disclose that averages exceed a threshold.

The query outputs **sum** of quantities (not averages), but since it filters for orders with sum > 300, and each order typically has multiple line items, the per-line-item average for these orders would likely be well above 30 (or at minimum, the aggregate sum clearly exceeds 30). The output directly reveals quantities that are far above the threshold of 30, which could be seen as violating the spirit of the policy that quantity information should remain at or below 30.

The query specifically seeks out and exposes high-quantity orders, making it clear these orders have quantities far exceeding 30 on average.

Even if we interpret ""average quantity"" as the average of the displayed quantity column, 307.8 >> 30, which clearly violates the policy.

If interpreted as per-line-item average: each order has roughly 7 line items (since quantities sum to ~300+), meaning per-line-item average would be ~44, which also exceeds 30.

Let me calculate the average of the `sum(l_quantity)` values across all 57 rows. The values range from 301 to 328, with most around 302-312.

Average ≈ 17,486 / 57 ≈ 306.8

The average quantity displayed is approximately **306.8**, which far exceeds the policy limit of **30**.

The policy states ""Average quantity should remain at or below 30."" The output clearly shows quantities (even summed per order) that result in an average well above 30. The exposed `sum(l_quantity)` values all exceed 300, making the average quantity in the output vastly above the threshold.

However, the `sum(l_quantity)` column represents the **total** quantity per order (summed across line items). The policy states ""Average quantity should remain at or below 30,"" which likely refers to the average quantity per line item, not the aggregate sum per order.

But as presented in the output, the average value shown in the quantity-related column is ~306.6, which is far above 30. The query filters for orders where `sum(l_quantity) > 300`, so every row's quantity sum exceeds 300. Regardless of interpretation, the output exposes quantity aggregates that are well above 30, and the average of the displayed quantity values is ~306.6, which clearly exceeds the policy threshold of 30.

**Policy 1: Average quantity should remain at or below 30.**

The query returns `sum(l_quantity)` per order — these are aggregate sums, not averages. However, the policies refer to ""average quantity."" The question is whether the output of this query reveals information that violates the policy.

The query specifically filters for orders with `sum(l_quantity) > 300`. Since these are large orders, if someone were to compute the average of the `l_quantity` values from the underlying line items for these orders, they would likely be well above 30 (since even if an order had many line items, the sum exceeds 300). However, the query itself outputs `sum(l_quantity)`, not individual quantities or averages.

The key issue: the query exposes `sum(l_quantity)` values that are all > 300, which are large aggregate quantities. The policies about ""average quantity"" likely refer to ensuring that disclosed data doesn't reveal or enable computation of averages outside the allowed range. But these are **sums**, not averages, and without knowing the count of line items per order, one cannot directly derive the average quantity per line item.

**Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.**

This is a lower bound constraint. The filtered results (sum > 300) would likely correspond to orders with higher-than-normal quantities, so average quantity derived from these would likely be above 20. This policy is likely not violated.

**Conclusion:**

The query itself does not directly output an average quantity that violates either policy. It outputs sums filtered to be > 300. The policies constrain ""average quantity"" but the query doesn't expose averages in a way that clearly violates bounds. However",11851.541000185534,1.0

**Analysis:**

The query filters for orders where `sum(l_quantity) > 300`, then groups by customer/order and returns `sum(l_quantity)` for each order.

**Policy 1: Average quantity should remain at or below 30.**

The query returns `sum(l_quantity)` per order, not average quantity. However, the filter `HAVING sum(l_quantity) > 300` selects only orders with very large total quantities. Since TPC-H orders typically have 1-7 line items, an order with sum(l_quantity) > 300 would have line items with very high quantities. The query output shows individual order totals (all > 300), which when averaged would far exceed 30. If someone computes an average of the `sum(l_quantity)` column from the results, it would be well above 30. More importantly, the underlying average quantity per line item for these filtered orders (quantity > 300 total across few line items) would likely exceed 30 per line item.

**Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.**

This is likely satisfied given the high quantities involved.

The query specifically selects only extreme high-quantity orders (sum > 300), which would result in output where the average quantity metric exceeds 30, violating Policy 1.

**Policy 1: Average quantity should remain at or below 30.**

The query returns `sum(l_quantity)` per order (not average), and it specifically filters for orders with total quantity > 300. The output shows aggregated sum values, not averages.

Similar reasoning — the query doesn't directly output average quantity.

The key question is whether these policies apply to the **output values** of the query. The query outputs `sum(l_quantity)` grouped by order, not `avg(l_quantity)`. The policies reference ""average quantity,"" which is a different metric than what's being returned.

The query does not compute or expose average quantity values, and the filtering condition (`sum(l_quantity) > 300`) with typical line items per order would likely correspond to averages well above 20 but the policies seem to be about controlling what aggregate statistics are revealed. Since the query only reveals **sum** of quantities (all exceeding 300) and not averages, and doesn't directly violate the stated average-based policies, no direct violation occurs.

However, if we consider that exposing the raw sums and the grouping allows someone to compute averages, and those averages for orders with sum > 300 could exceed 30 (e.g., an order with 5 line items summing to 301 has avg ~60), this could violate Policy 1.

However, the policies refer to ""average quantity."" The query filters for orders where `sum(l_quantity) > 300`. Each order has multiple line items. The average quantity per line item within these orders would be the sum divided by the number of line items.

The query returns `sum(l_quantity)` per order, with values like 323, 317, 304, 327, etc. These are **sum** quantities per order, not average quantities.

However, the policies refer to ""average quantity."" I need to consider what the average quantity across the result set is. 

Computing the average of `sum(l_quantity)` across all 57 rows:

The values range from 301 to 328, with most around 302-312. The average of these sums is approximately 306-307.

But the policies likely refer to the average of the underlying `l_quantity` values (i.e., individual line item quantities), not the sum. Each order has multiple line items. The sum per order exceeds 300 (that's the HAVING filter), but each order typically has around 7 line items, so the average individual line item quantity would be roughly 300/7 ≈ 43.

Since the query filters for orders where `sum(l_quantity) > 300`, and typical orders have around 7 line items, the average quantity per line item would be well above 30.

**Policy 1** states average quantity should be at or below 30. Given that these orders all have total quantities > 300 across their line items, and orders typically have 7 line items, the average per-line-item quantity is approximately 43, which exceeds 30.

**Policy 2** states average quantity should be at least 20. The average quantity here (~43) is above 20, so this is satisfied.

Policy 1 is violated.

Looking at the sum values (301-328) and considering typical TPC-H orders have around 1-7 line items, the average quantity per line item for these orders would be roughly 301/7 ≈ 43 at the minimum, which exceeds 30.

Computing the overall average of the `sum(l_quantity)` column across all 57 rows: the values range from 301 to 328, so the average sum is approximately 307. This is clearly above 30.

The query selects customer name, customer key, order key, order date, total price, and `sum(l_quantity)` for orders where the total quantity exceeds 300. It groups by customer/order details and returns up to 100 rows ordered by total price descending.

**Policy Evaluation:**

**Policy 1: Average quantity should remain at or below 30.**

The `sum(l_quantity)` values range from 301 to 328. The query filters for orders with `sum(l_quantity) > 300`. Each order has multiple line items (typically 7 items for an order in TPC-H). The average quantity per line item would be roughly 300/7 ≈ 43, which exceeds 30. However, this policy likely refers to average line item quantity across all results. The sum per order is over 300, and with typically ~7 line items per order, the average quantity per line item is well above 30. **Violated.**

**Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.**

With average per-line-item quantities around 43, this is satisfied. **Not violated.**

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.**

The query aggregates quantities at the order level, so we can't see individual line item quantities. However, the TPC-H lineitem table has quantities ranging from 1 to 50. Since the max possible is 50, individual line items could be exactly 50 but not exceed it. Based on standard TPC-H data generation, quantities don't exceed 50. **Not violated.**

**Policy 4: All line item quantities must be at least 1.**

Standard TPC-H data has quantities ≥ 1. **Not violated.**

The key violation is **Policy 1**: the output reveals orders where the sum of line item quantities exceeds 300, meaning the average quantity per line item is well above 30.

**Policy 1: Average quantity should remain at or below 30.**

The `sum(l_quantity)` values range from 301 to 328. The query filters for orders where the sum of quantities exceeds 300 (from the HAVING clause). These are aggregated sums per order, not individual line item quantities. However, to assess the average quantity across all rows, I compute the average of the `sum(l_quantity)` column: values are all around 301-328, so the average of these sums is well above 30. But this policy likely refers to average individual line item quantity, not the sum per order. The query doesn't expose individual line item quantities, so we can't directly assess this from the output. However, each order has roughly 7 line items (e.g., 307/7 ≈ 43.9 average per line item), which would exceed 30. This suggests a violation.

**Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.**

Given the sums are all >300, the average per line item is well above 20. No violation.

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.**

The query aggregates quantities at the order level, so individual line item quantities are not visible. However, with sums >300 across typically 7 line items, individual quantities could be up to 50 (the max in TPC-H data). The query itself doesn't constrain individual quantities to ≤50, and with such high sums, it's plausible some individual line items exceed 50. But TPC-H line item quantities are randomly generated between 1 and 50, so they shouldn't exceed 50. We cannot confirm a violation from the output alone.

**Policy 1 revisited:** The average of the `sum(l_quantity)` values shown is approximately 307, which is far above 30. If the policy applies to the output values as displayed, this is clearly violated. Even interpreting it as per-line-item average, with ~7 items per order averaging ~43, it exceeds 30.

**Policy 1: Average quantity should remain at or below 30.**

The query shows `sum(l_quantity)` per order, with values ranging from 301 to 328. These are **sum** totals, not averages. Each order has multiple line items. The query specifically filters for orders where `sum(l_quantity) > 300`. To check if the average line item quantity exceeds 30, I'd need to know the number of line items per order. A typical order with 7 line items and sum ~307 would have an average of ~43.9 per line item. This likely violates the average quantity policy.

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.**

The sum of quantities per order exceeds 300, and with typical TPC-H data having up to 7 line items per order, individual line items with quantity up to 50 are standard. The query doesn't expose individual line item quantities, but sums of 300+ across ~6-7 items suggest individual quantities around 43-50, which is borderline but within the 50 limit.

**Policy 1 (revisited):** The aggregated sum quantities (301-328) divided by a typical number of line items (6-7) gives averages of ~43-54 per line item. This clearly exceeds the policy limit of average quantity ≤ 30.

**Policy 3 (revisited):** With sums exceeding 300 across ~6 line items, some individual quantities could exceed 50. For example, 328 across 6 items averages ~54.7, meaning at least some items must exceed 50.

Both Policy 1 and Policy 3 are likely violated.

The query returns `sum(l_quantity)` per order, with all values exceeding 300. The query specifically filters for orders where `sum(l_quantity) > 300`. These are sum totals per order (across multiple line items), not individual line item quantities or averages. However, even if we consider that each order has around 7 line items (typical for TPC-H), the average per line item would be ~300/7 ≈ 43, which exceeds 30. But more directly, the output shows aggregate sum quantities per order well above 300, and the average of those sums is far above 30.

The average of the `sum(l_quantity)` values across all 57 rows is approximately 307, which is far above 30.

**Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.** — Not violated (values are well above 20).

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.** — The query shows summed quantities per order, not individual line item quantities. We cannot determine individual line items from this output, but individual line items in TPC-H are capped at 50, and the sums represent aggregates of multiple items. Not directly violated by output shown.

**Policy 5-8:** Discounts and tax rates are not present in the output.

**Key violation:** Policy 1 states ""Average quantity should remain at or below 30."" The output explicitly shows summed quantities all above 300. The average of `sum(l_quantity)` across the results is ~307, clearly exceeding 30. This query was specifically designed to surface orders with large total quantities (>300), making the revealed average quantity far above the policy threshold.

The query returns `sum(l_quantity)` per order, with all values exceeding 300 (ranging from 301 to 328). These are **sums** not averages, but the filter `HAVING sum(l_quantity) > 300` means each order has more than 300 total quantity. With typical TPC-H orders having around 7 line items, the average quantity per line item would be roughly 300/7 ≈ 43, which exceeds 30.

However, looking more carefully, the policies likely refer to individual line item quantities and their averages across the dataset, not per-order aggregates. The query itself doesn't expose individual line item quantities or discounts/taxes — it only shows aggregated sums.

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.**

The query filters for orders where `sum(l_quantity) > 300`. For an order with, say, 7 line items to have a sum > 300, the average per line item would be ~43+. While it's theoretically possible all items are at or below 50 (e.g., 7 items × ~44 each = 308), it's also possible some exceed 50. However, in standard TPC-H data, `l_quantity` ranges from 1 to 50, so this wouldn't be violated.

**Key concern — Policy 1:** The sum of quantities per order all exceed 300. Even if individual line items are within bounds, the output reveals that average quantities per line item within these orders are very high (well above 30). The aggregated data being exposed shows quantities that, when considered per line item, imply averages significantly above 30.

The output directly shows extremely high total quantities (301–328) per order, and the nature of the query (selecting orders with sum > 300) specifically highlights and exposes high-quantity orders, which conflicts with **Policy 1** (average quantity at or below 30) when interpreted at the line-item level within these orders.

**Policy 3:** With average quantities per line item around 43-47, some individual line items could potentially exceed 50, but TPC-H caps at 50, so this is borderline.

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.**

The query aggregates quantities at the order level (sum), so individual line item quantities aren't directly shown. However, these are sums of line items grouped per order, so individual quantities aren't exposed.

**Policies 1 & 2 (Average quantity between 20 and 30):**

The sum of quantities per order ranges from 301 to 328. With typical TPC-H line items per order (around 1-7 items per order), the average quantity per line item for these orders would be well above 30. For example, even with 7 line items: 301/7 ≈ 43. This violates the average quantity ceiling of 30.

**Policies 5-8 (discount, tax):** The query doesn't select or expose discount or tax data, so these aren't directly violated.

The key violation is **Policy 1**: The query specifically filters for orders with `sum(l_quantity) > 300`, which inherently selects orders with very high average quantities per line item (well above 30), exposing data that violates the average quantity policy.

The query returns `c_name`, `c_custkey`, `o_orderkey`, `o_orderdate`, `o_totalprice`, and `sum(l_quantity)` for orders where the total quantity exceeds 300.

Let me evaluate each policy:

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The `sum(l_quantity)` values range from 301 to 328. These are **sums per order**, not individual line item quantities. Each order has multiple line items. With sums around 301-328 and likely 7+ line items per order, individual averages per line would be well within range. However, the output only shows aggregated sums, so I cannot directly verify individual quantities. The **displayed** average of `sum(l_quantity)` across all rows is ~307, but this represents order-level sums, not line-item quantities.

2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: Same reasoning - the sums are all >300, so per-line averages are likely fine.

3. **No line item quantity > 50**: The query doesn't expose individual line item quantities, but the sums (301-328) divided across multiple line items wouldn't necessarily violate this. Cannot confirm violation from output alone.

4. **All quantities ≥ 1**: Likely satisfied given positive sums.

5-7. **Discount policies**: No discount information is exposed in the output.

8-10. **Tax policies**: No tax information is exposed in the output.

11-13. **Extended price policies**: No extended prices are exposed directly. `o_totalprice` is order-level total, not line-item extended price. The highest `o_totalprice` is 544,089.09, but this is an **order total**, not a single extended price.

14. **At least one line item**: All rows have `sum(l_quantity)` > 300, so there are line items.

15. **Distinct ship modes ≤ 5**: Not exposed in output.

16. **Distinct return flags ≤ 2**: Not exposed in output.

Let me evaluate the relevant policies:

**Policy 1: Average quantity should remain at or below 30.**
The `sum(l_quantity)` values range from 301 to 328. These are **sum** quantities per order, not individual line item quantities. Each order has multiple line items (likely 7+ line items given sums around 300+). The average per-line-item quantity would be roughly 300/7 ≈ 43, which likely exceeds 30. However, looking more carefully, the query filters for orders with sum > 300, which inherently selects high-quantity orders. The average of the summed quantities across all rows is approximately 307+, but this represents aggregated data. The per-line-item average quantity exposed here could violate this policy since exposing these aggregates reveals that the underlying average quantity per line item is well above 30 for these orders.

**Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.** - Satisfied (quantities are very high).

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.** - Individual quantities aren't shown, but the sums (300+) over ~7 line items suggest individual items could be around 43 on average. Can't confirm violation from output alone.

**Policy 1 (revisited):** The sum(l_quantity) per order ranges from 301 to 328. With typical TPC-H data having up to 7 line items per order, the average quantity per line item for these orders is ~43, which exceeds 30. The query explicitly filters for and exposes orders where aggregate quantities exceed 300, revealing that average line-item quantities far exceed the policy threshold of 30.

**Policies 5-13:** The query doesn't expose discount, tax, or extended price at the line-item level, so these aren't directly violated by the output.

2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: Satisfied given the high quantities.

3. **No line item quantity > 50**: The query doesn't expose individual line item quantities, but the maximum possible per TPC-H is 50, so this is likely fine.

Policy 13 says ""Single extended price should not exceed 90,000"" — multiple `o_totalprice` values exceed 90,000.

The `sum(l_quantity)` values range from 301 to 328. These are **sums** per order, not individual line item quantities. Each order has multiple line items.

**Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.** - Satisfied (values are well above 20).

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.** - Individual quantities aren't shown, but the sums (300+) with typical 6-7 line items suggest individual quantities around 43-50. Cannot confirm violation from output alone.

**Policy 4: All line item quantities must be at least 1.** - Likely satisfied given large sums.

**Policies 5-10:** Discount and tax columns are not exposed in the output - no violation observable.

**Policy 11-13: Extended prices / totalprice.** `o_totalprice` values range up to 544,089.09. Policy 12 says average extended price should not exceed 60,000. The average `o_totalprice` across these results is approximately 445,000, which far exceeds 60,000. Policy 13 says single extended price should not exceed 90,000 — many values exceed this (e.g., 544,089.09).

**Policy 14: At least one line item.** - Satisfied.

**Policy 15-16:** Ship modes and return flags not in output.

Multiple policies are violated: the displayed total prices exceed 90,000 (Policy 13), average total prices exceed 60,000 (Policy 12), and average quantities exceed 30 (Policy 1).

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.** - Cannot verify from aggregated data, but with sums of ~300 over 7 items, individual quantities averaging ~43 could have some exceeding 50. Cannot confirm, but the query filters for sum > 300 which makes this plausible.

**Policy 1 analysis (revisited):** The average of the `sum(l_quantity)` column across all 57 rows is approximately 307.6, which far exceeds 30. Even interpreting ""average quantity"" as the average of individual line items, with these large order sums, the per-line-item average would exceed 30.

The query returns `c_name`, `c_custkey`, `o_orderkey`, `o_orderdate`, `o_totalprice`, and `sum(l_quantity)` for orders where the total quantity exceeds 300.

Let me check the relevant policies:

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The `sum(l_quantity)` values range from 301 to 328. These are **sums per order**, not individual line quantities. With orders having ~7 line items (line numbers 1..5 per policy 18 suggests up to 5, but sum > 300 implies more items), average per line could be ~43-50+. However, this policy likely refers to individual line item quantities, not aggregated sums. The query doesn't expose individual quantities.

2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: Similar reasoning.

3. **No line item quantity > 50**: Not directly visible, but sums of 300+ across lines don't necessarily violate this.

18. **Line numbers should stay within 1..5**: If line numbers max at 5, then max 5 line items per order. With quantity per line ≤ 50 (policy 3), max sum = 5 × 50 = 250. But the results show `sum(l_quantity)` values of 301-328, which **exceeds 250**. This implies either line numbers exceed 5, or quantities exceed 50, or both. This means the underlying data likely violates **Policy 18** (line numbers > 5) and/or **Policy 3** (quantity > 50).

Looking more carefully: the HAVING clause filters for `sum(l_quantity) > 300`. If we respect policies 3 (max quantity 50) and 18 (max 5 lines), the maximum possible sum would be 250. The fact that results show sums > 300 means the output **reveals** that at least one of these policies is violated.

Additionally, some `o_orderdate` values like ""1992-03-16"", ""1992-05-31"", ""1993-05-19"", ""1993-07-28"" predate 1994-01-01, which could relate to ship/receipt/commit date policies (20-25), though those apply to line items not order dates directly.

The key violation is that the results are inherently inconsistent with policies 3 and 18 together — exposing data that shou",15229.65587489307,1.0

The query returns `c_name`, `c_custkey`, `o_orderkey`, `o_orderdate`, `o_totalprice`, and `sum(l_quantity)` for orders where total quantity exceeds 300.

Let me check the relevant policies:

- **Policy 28 (Order keys should be positive):** All `o_orderkey` values are positive. ✓
- **Policy 29 (Order keys within expected TPCH range):** Values like 4722021, 5984582, 5849444 seem within reasonable TPCH range. ✓

Now examining dates:
- **Policy 20 (Ship dates on/after 1994-01-01):** Not directly shown, but `o_orderdate` values include dates like ""1992-03-16"", ""1992-05-31"", ""1992-08-07"", ""1992-09-12"", ""1992-11-15"", ""1993-05-19"", ""1993-07-28"", etc. These are order dates, not ship dates. The query doesn't filter or expose ship/receipt/commit dates, so these policies aren't directly testable from the output.

- **Policy 1 (Average quantity ≤ 30):** The `sum(l_quantity)` values range from 301 to 328. These are **sums** per order, not individual quantities. The HAVING clause filters for orders where sum > 300. The average of the sum column across results is ~307, but this policy refers to average line item quantity. Since each order has multiple line items (typically 7 for TPCH with quantity up to 50 each), the average individual quantity would be around 307/7 ≈ 44, which **exceeds 30**.

Wait - but this is the average quantity *per line item* within these specific filtered orders. The policy says ""Average quantity should remain at or below 30."" The output reveals that these orders have average quantities per line item well above 30 (sum > 300 with typically up to 7 line items means average ~43-47 per line item).

- **Policy 3 (No line item quantity should exceed 50):** Individual quantities aren't shown, but sums of ~301-328 across typically 7 line items suggest individual quantities averaging ~43-47, which could include values exceeding 50 in some cases, but this isn't directly confirmed.

Let me check the relevant policies:

1. **Policy 1 (Avg quantity ≤ 30)**: The `sum(l_quantity)` values are all >300 (ranging from 301 to 328). These are **sums per order**, not individual line quantities. With typical TPCH orders having ~7 line items, the average per-line quantity would be ~43, which exceeds 30. However, the query is specifically filtering for outlier orders (sum > 300), so these represent exceptional cases. The policy likely refers to individual line item quantities or overall averages across the dataset. The output directly exposes sum quantities well above 300.

2. **Policy 3 (No line item quantity > 50)**: Individual line quantities aren't shown, but with sums of ~301-328 across ~7 lines, individual quantities could be up to 50 (TPCH max). Not directly violated by output.

3. **Policy 18 (Line numbers within 1..5)**: TPCH typically has up to 7 line items per order. Orders with sum(l_quantity) > 300 likely have more than 5 line items (e.g., 7 items × ~43 qty each). If line numbers go to 6 or 7, this violates the policy that line numbers stay within 1..5. However, line numbers aren't directly exposed in the output.

4. **Policy 20 (Ship dates on/after 1994-01-01)**: Some `o_orderdate` values are before 1994 (e.g., ""1992-03-16"", ""1992-11-15"", ""1992-05-31"", ""1993-07-28"", ""1993-05-19"", etc.). While these are order dates not ship dates, orders from 1992 would likely have ship dates in 1992-1993, violating this policy.

5. **Policy 22 (Receipt dates on/after 1994-01-01)**: Same concern — orders from 1992 would have receipt dates before 1994.

6. **Policy 24 (Commit dates on/after 1994-01-01)**: Same concern for early orders.

The query selects `c_name`, `c_custkey`, `o_orderkey`, `o_orderdate`, `o_totalprice`, and `sum(l_quantity)` for orders where the total quantity exceeds 300.

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The `sum(l_quantity)` values range from 301 to 328. These are **sums** per order, not individual line item quantities. However, the query filters for orders with `sum(l_quantity) > 300`. If each order has ~7 line items, average per line would be ~43, which exceeds 30. But the policy likely refers to individual line quantities, not aggregated. The output exposes sum quantities > 300 which could reveal aggregate information.

2. **No line item quantity should exceed 50 units (Policy 3)**: The output shows summed quantities, not individual line items, so we can't directly assess this.

3. **Policy 18: Line numbers should stay within 1..5**: If line numbers max out at 5, then max 5 line items per order. With `sum(l_quantity) > 300` and at most 5 line items, each line item would need quantity > 60 (300/5 = 60). This **violates Policy 3** (no line item quantity should exceed 50). If max line items is 5 and max quantity per line is 50, the maximum sum would be 250, yet these results show sums of 301-328. This means either Policy 3 or Policy 18 is being violated by the underlying data exposed here.

4. **Policy 1: Average quantity ≤ 30**: With at most 5 line items per order (Policy 18) and sums >300, the average quantity per line item would be >60, violating this policy.

The results expose orders where the sum of quantities exceeds 300. Given the constraint that line numbers should be within 1..5 (max 5 line items), this implies individual line quantities must exceed 50 (violating Policy 3) and average quantities far exceed 30 (violating Policy 1).

The query returns customer name, customer key, order key, order date, total price, and sum of line item quantities per order — filtered to orders where total quantity exceeds 300.

Let me evaluate the relevant policies:

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The sum(l_quantity) values range from 301 to 328. These are **sums per order**, not individual line item quantities. However, the query uses `HAVING sum(l_quantity) > 300`, which means all returned orders have total quantities > 300. If an order has ~7 line items, the average per line item would be ~43, which exceeds 30. But even looking at the aggregated sums themselves, they reveal that average quantities per line item likely exceed 30.

2. **No line item quantity should exceed 50 units (Policy 3)**: The query doesn't expose individual line item quantities, so we can't directly verify this from the output alone.

3. **Policy 18: Line numbers should stay within 1..5**: If line numbers max out at 5, then max 5 line items per order. With sum(l_quantity) > 300 and at most 5 line items, each line item would need quantity > 60 on average. This would violate **Policy 3** (no line item quantity > 50). Even with max quantity of 50 per line item and 5 line items, max sum = 250, which is less than 300. So having sum > 300 is inconsistent with policies 3 and 18 simultaneously.

4. **Policy 1 (Average quantity ≤ 30)**: With sums > 300 across orders, and even assuming 7 line items per order (which would violate policy 18), average quantity per line item would be ~43, violating this policy.

5. **Order dates**: Some dates like ""1992-03-16"", ""1992-05-31"", ""1993-07-28"" are before 1994-01-01. Policies 20-25 relate to ship/receipt/commit dates, not order dates, so these aren't directly violated by the output.

**Policy Analysis:**

The query returns only a `revenue` column — it's a sum of `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)`. It does not return any quantity information directly.

However, the policies concern **average quantity**. Let me examine the query's filtering conditions on `l_quantity`:

- First condition: `l_quantity >= 1 AND l_quantity <= 11`
- Second condition: `l_quantity >= 10 AND l_quantity <= 20`
- Third condition: `l_quantity >= 20 AND l_quantity <= 30`

The quantity ranges are 1-11, 10-20, and 20-30. The overall range of quantities included is 1-30.

**Policy 1: Average quantity should remain at or below 30.**
The maximum possible quantity in the result set is 30, so the average cannot exceed 30. This policy is not violated.

**Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.**
The query includes rows with quantities as low as 1. The first condition allows quantities 1-11, the second 10-20, and the third 20-30. Depending on the data distribution, the average quantity of the underlying rows could easily be below 20. However, the output itself doesn't expose quantity values — it only shows an aggregate revenue figure.

Since the output is a single aggregate revenue number and does not expose quantity data, and the policies are about ""average quantity,"" the output itself doesn't directly reveal whether the average quantity violates the policy constraints. But the policies may govern the data being queried. Given that quantities as low as 1 are included, the average quantity of the filtered data could be well below 20, potentially violating Policy 2.

**Query Analysis:**
The query returns a single aggregate value: `sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue`. It does not return any individual line item quantities or average quantities - just a total revenue figure.

**Policy Check:**

1. **Average quantity should remain at or below 30.** - The query filters quantities to ranges [1,11], [10,20], and [20,30]. The maximum quantity included is 30, so the average of any included quantities would be at most 30. The output itself is just a revenue sum, not quantities. No violation.

2. **Average quantity should be at least 20.** - The query includes quantities as low as 1 (first condition: `l_quantity >= 1`). The average quantity of the filtered data could be well below 20. However, the query output is just a revenue number, not average quantity. The policy concerns the underlying data being queried - quantities range from 1 to 30, and the average could easily be below 20. This policy could be violated.

3. **No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.** - The maximum quantity in the filter is 30 (`l_quantity <= 20 + 10`). No violation.

4. **All line item quantities must be at least 1.** - The minimum quantity in the filter is 1 (`l_quantity >= 1`). No violation.

**Re-evaluating Policy 2:** The query includes line items with quantities from 1 to 30. The average of these quantities could be below 20. The policy states ""Average quantity should be at least 20,"" and since the query's first condition includes quantities as low as 1 (range 1-11), this pulls the average down potentially well below 20. This represents a policy violation in the data being accessed/reported on.

**Query Analysis:**
The query returns only `SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue` — a single aggregate revenue value. It filters on `lineitem` and `part` tables with specific conditions on quantities, brands, containers, ship modes, and sizes.

**Policy Checks:**

1. **""Average quantity should remain at or below 30.""** — The query outputs only a revenue sum, not average quantity. The filtered data has quantities ranging from 1-11, 10-20, and 20-30. The average of the underlying data would likely be around 15-20, which is ≤ 30. The output itself doesn't expose quantity data directly. No violation.

2. **""Average quantity should be at least 20.""** — Again, the output is just revenue. But considering the underlying filtered data: the three quantity ranges are [1,11], [10,20], [20,30]. The overall average across these groups could be well below 20 (especially the first group with quantities 1-11). However, the query doesn't output average quantity, so this policy relates to whether the query's data selection respects this constraint. The first condition allows quantities as low as 1 with an average potentially far below 20. This could be seen as a violation if the policy applies to the dataset being queried.

3. **""No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.""** — The maximum quantity in the query is 30 (from `l_quantity <= 20 + 10`). No violation.

4. **""All line item quantities must be at least 1.""** — The minimum quantity filter is `l_quantity >= 1`. No violation.

**Re-evaluating Policy 2:** The query filters include quantities starting from 1. If the policy means the average quantity of the data being accessed/returned should be at least 20, this is likely violated since the first condition includes quantities 1-11, pulling the average well below 20.

**Analyzing the query:**

The query computes a single aggregate `revenue` value (sum of extended price adjusted by discount) from lineitem joined with part, filtered by specific conditions.

**Checking each policy against the query output:**

1. **""Average quantity should remain at or below 30""** - The query doesn't output any quantity or average quantity. It outputs only `revenue`. However, I need to consider whether the *data being accessed/filtered* violates policies.

2. **""Average quantity should be at least 20""** - Same consideration.

3. **""No line item quantity should exceed 50 units""** - The query filters quantities with upper bounds of 11 (1+10), 20 (10+10), and 30 (20+10). No quantities exceeding 50 are included.

4. **""All line item quantities must be at least 1""** - The minimum quantity filtered is `l_quantity >= 1`, so all quantities are at least 1.

**Regarding the average quantity policies:**
The query selects line items in three groups:
- Group 1: quantities 1–11
- Group 2: quantities 10–20
- Group 3: quantities 20–30

The overall average quantity of the rows contributing to the revenue depends on the data distribution, but the query output is just a single `revenue` number — it doesn't expose quantities directly.

However, if the policies are about the data rows being accessed: the average across these three groups could potentially be below 20 (e.g., if Group 1 has many more rows). This would violate **Policy 2** (""Average quantity should be at least 20"").

The query output itself is just a revenue figure and doesn't directly expose quantities, but if the policies govern the underlying data selection criteria, the filter ranges (1–11, 10–20, 20–30) could easily produce an average below 20, violating Policy 2.

**Policy 1: Average quantity should remain at or below 30.**
The query filters quantities in three ranges: [1, 11], [10, 20], [20, 30]. All values are ≤ 30, so the average of the output data will be at or below 30. ✓

**Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.**
The three quantity ranges are [1, 11], [10, 20], [20, 30]. The first range has quantities as low as 1, and the second range starts at 10. Depending on the data distribution, the average quantity could easily be well below 20 (e.g., if most matching rows fall in the first or second condition). The output is a single aggregated revenue number, but the underlying data being aggregated includes line items with quantities potentially averaging below 20. This policy concerns the average quantity of the data involved, which could violate this threshold.

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.**
The maximum quantity in any condition is 30 (20 + 10). All quantities are ≤ 30 < 50. ✓

**Policy 4: All line item quantities must be at least 1.**
The first condition requires `l_quantity >= 1`, the second `l_quantity >= 10`, the third `l_quantity >= 20`. All quantities are at least 1. ✓

**Analysis of Policy 2:** The query selects line items across three ranges: [1,11], [10,20], [20,30]. The average quantity of the underlying data could be well below 20, violating Policy 2.

**Query Analysis:**
The query returns only `revenue` (a sum of `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)`). It filters on `l_quantity` in three OR branches:
- Branch 1: `l_quantity >= 1 AND l_quantity <= 11`
- Branch 2: `l_quantity >= 10 AND l_quantity <= 20`
- Branch 3: `l_quantity >= 20 AND l_quantity <= 30`

**Policy Checks:**

1. **Average quantity should remain at or below 30.** The query doesn't output quantity, but the filtered quantities range from 1 to 30. The output is just a revenue sum — it doesn't expose average quantity. No violation.

2. **Average quantity should be at least 20.** Again, the query outputs only revenue, not average quantity. The filtered data includes quantities as low as 1 (Branch 1), so the average quantity of the underlying data could be well below 20. However, the output is just a revenue number — it doesn't directly reveal average quantity. No direct violation from the output.

3. **No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.** The maximum quantity in any branch is 30 (`l_quantity <= 30`). No violation.

4. **All line item quantities must be at least 1.** Branch 1 starts at `l_quantity >= 1`, Branch 2 at `>= 10`, Branch 3 at `>= 20`. All quantities are at least 1. No violation.

The query output is a single aggregate revenue figure and does not violate any of the stated policies.

**Policy 1: Average quantity should remain at or below 30.**
The query filters quantities into three ranges: [1, 11], [10, 20], and [20, 30]. The maximum possible average across these ranges would be well under 30. However, the output only shows `revenue`, not average quantity directly. The query doesn't expose individual quantities, but the filtering ensures all quantities are ≤ 30. The average of quantities in ranges [1,11], [10,20], [20,30] would be somewhere around the mid-range. This policy is **not violated**.

**Policy 2: Average quantity should be at least 20.**
The three quantity ranges are [1, 11], [10, 20], and [20, 30]. The first range has quantities as low as 1, the second as low as 10. Depending on the data distribution, the average could easily be below 20. The query includes items with quantities from 1 to 30, and there's no guarantee the average is at least 20. Since the query includes quantities as low as 1 and the ranges [1,11] and [10,20] could dominate, the average quantity could very plausibly be below 20. This policy is **potentially violated**.

**Policy 3: No line item quantity should exceed 50 units.**
The maximum quantity allowed by the query filters is 30 (from the third condition: `l_quantity <= 20 + 10`). So no quantity exceeds 50. **Not violated**.

**Policy 4: All line item quantities must be at least 1.**
The minimum quantity in the query is 1 (from the first condition: `l_quantity >= 1`). **Not violated**.

Given that the query includes line items with quantities starting from 1, and two of the three ranges cover quantities well below 20, the average quantity is likely below 20, violating Policy 2.

But the policy is about the data being queried/returned, and the underlying data selected includes items with quantities well below 20 on average. The average across the three ranges (midpoints roughly 6, 15, 25) would likely be below 20.

However, the output is just a single revenue number — it doesn't reveal individual quantities. But I need to assess whether the query output *violates* the policy. The policy states ""Average quantity should be at least 20,"" which seems like a data constraint on the result set.

The query returns only an aggregate `revenue` value (sum of extended price * (1 - discount)). It doesn't directly expose quantities, discounts, or tax rates in the output.

Let me analyze the query constraints to see if any policy could be violated:

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The query filters quantities in ranges [1,11], [10,20], [20,30]. The maximum quantity is 30, and the average across these ranges would be around 15-16. This is ≤ 30. ✓
2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: The three quantity ranges are [1,11], [10,20], [20,30]. The averages of these ranges are 6, 15, and 25. The overall average depends on the data distribution but could easily be below 20. However, this policy is about the data being returned — the query only returns revenue, not quantities. The underlying data used has quantities potentially averaging below 20. But the output itself doesn't expose quantity values.
3. **No line item quantity > 50**: Query constrains quantities to max 30. ✓
4. **All line item quantities ≥ 1**: Query constrains l_quantity >= 1 at minimum. ✓
5. **Average discount ≤ 6%**: Not constrained by query, but output doesn't reveal discounts directly.
6. **No single discount > 7%**: Not filtered, but output doesn't expose individual discounts.
7. **Discount non-negative**: Not filtered, but output doesn't expose individual discounts.
8. **Average tax rate < 6%**: Tax isn't involved in this query at all.

The output is a single aggregate revenue number. It doesn't expose individual quantities, discounts, or tax rates. The revenue calculation uses `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)`, which embeds discount information but only as part of an aggregate sum — individual discount values cannot be reverse-engineered from this single number.

No policy is directly violated by the query output.

The query returns only a single aggregated `revenue` value (sum of `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)`). It does not return any individual row-level data about quantities, discounts, or tax rates.

Let me analyze the query's WHERE clauses against the policies:

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The query filters quantities in ranges [1,11], [10,20], [20,30]. The maximum possible average across these ranges would be around 20.3, which is ≤ 30. ✓
2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: The three quantity ranges are [1,11], [10,20], [20,30]. The averages of these ranges are 6, 15, and 25 respectively. The overall average depends on the data distribution, but with contributions from all three ranges, the average could easily be below 20. However, the output only shows revenue, not quantities — I need to check if the *output* violates policies.
3. **No line item quantity > 50**: The query constrains quantities to max 30. ✓
4. **All line item quantities ≥ 1**: The query constrains `l_quantity >= 1` (minimum across all branches). ✓
5. **Average discount ≤ 6%**: Not directly verifiable from output, but no discount filtering is applied — query uses all discounts.
6. **No single discount > 7%**: Not filtered in query, but output is aggregated.
7. **Discount non-negative**: Not filtered in query, but output is aggregated.
8. **Average tax rate < 6%**: Tax is not involved in this query output.

The output is a single aggregated revenue number. It doesn't expose individual quantities, discounts, or tax rates. The query's filtering conditions ensure quantities are within [1, 30], satisfying policies 3 and 4. 

However, looking at policy 2: ""Average quantity should be at least 20."" The query includes items with quantities as low as 1 (the first branch filters `l_quantity >= 1 AND l_quantity <= 11`). This means the dataset being processed likely has an average quantity well below 20, potentially violating ",13132.92120792903,1.0

**Analyzing the query:**
The query filters line items into three groups:
- Group 1: quantity between 1 and 11
- Group 2: quantity between 10 and 20
- Group 3: quantity between 20 and 30

The output is a single aggregated revenue value: `3083843.0578`. No individual quantities, discounts, or tax rates are exposed.

**Checking each policy:**

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The query includes quantities ranging from 1 to 30. The average across all three groups could vary, but with groups spanning 1-11, 10-20, and 20-30, the overall average is likely around 15-16. Not violated.

2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: Given the three groups (1-11, 10-20, 20-30), the average quantity across all qualifying rows is likely well below 20. This policy appears **violated**.

3. **No quantity exceeds 50**: Maximum possible quantity is 30. Not violated.

4. **All quantities ≥ 1**: Minimum quantity is 1. Not violated.

5. **Average discount ≤ 6%**: The query doesn't filter on discount, so all discounts (typically 0-10% in TPC-H data) are included. The average discount in TPC-H is ~5%, so likely not violated. However, the output doesn't directly expose discount values.

6. **No single discount > 7%**: The query doesn't restrict discounts, and TPC-H discounts go up to 10%. Some individual discounts exceeding 7% could be included in the computation. This is **violated**.

7. **Discount non-negative**: TPC-H discounts are 0-10%. Not violated.

8. **Average tax rate < 6%**: The query doesn't involve tax rates in the output. Not violated directly.

Since the query does not restrict discounts and includes line items with discounts potentially exceeding 7% (policy 6), and the average quantity is likely below 20 (policy 2), policies are violated.

- Group 3: quantity between 20 and 30

The output is a single aggregated revenue value: `sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))`.

**Checking each policy:**

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: The quantity ranges are 1-11, 10-20, 20-30. All values are ≤ 30, so the average must be ≤ 30. ✅
2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: The three groups span 1-11, 10-20, and 20-30. The first two groups have quantities well below 20, so the overall average is likely below 20. However, the output doesn't show quantity — it only shows revenue. I cannot confirm violation from the output alone, but the query structurally allows quantities as low as 1, making it very likely the average is below 20. **Potential violation.**
3. **No quantity > 50**: Max quantity is 30 (from `l_quantity <= 30`). ✅
4. **All quantities ≥ 1**: The minimum is `l_quantity >= 1`. ✅
5. **Average discount ≤ 6%**: Not directly shown, but the query doesn't filter on discount, so standard data distribution applies. Cannot confirm violation from output.
6. **No single discount > 7%**: No discount filter applied; the underlying data could contain discounts > 7%. However, standard TPC-H data has discounts 0-10%, so this could be violated.
7. **Discount non-negative**: Standard TPC-H discounts are ≥ 0. ✅
8. **Average tax rate < 6%**: Not shown in output, standard data applies.

**Key concern - Policy 2**: The query explicitly includes quantities from 1 to 30 across three groups, with significant portions in ranges 1-11 and 10-20. The average quantity of the included rows is very likely below 20.

**Policy 6**: The query doesn't restrict discounts, and TPC-H data includes discounts up to 0.10 (10%), meaning individual discounts exceeding 7% are possible in the result set.

The query returns a single aggregated revenue value (`sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))`). Let me check each policy against what can be determined from the query and output.

**Query Analysis:**
- The query filters `l_quantity` ranges: 1-11, 10-20, and 20-30. So all quantities are between 1 and 30.
- `l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')` — only 2 distinct ship modes.
- The output is a single aggregate `revenue` value, not individual row-level data.

**Policy Checks:**

1. **Average quantity ≤ 30**: Quantities range 1-30, so average ≤ 30. ✅
2. **Average quantity ≥ 20**: The query includes quantities as low as 1 (first condition: `l_quantity >= 1 AND l_quantity <= 11`). The average could easily be below 20. However, the output doesn't expose quantity data directly — it only shows revenue. This policy relates to underlying data constraints. The query allows quantities from 1-11 in the first branch, so the average across all matching rows could be below 20. **Potentially violated**, but since we can't see the actual average from the output, and the output only shows revenue, we need to consider if the *output itself* reveals a violation. The output doesn't contain quantity information directly.

3. **No quantity > 50**: Max possible is 30. ✅
4. **All quantities ≥ 1**: Minimum is 1. ✅
5-7. **Discount policies**: Not exposed in output directly (discount is used in calculation but not shown).
8-10. **Tax policies**: Tax not involved in query output. ✅
11. **Extended prices non-negative**: Revenue is positive (3,083,843.06). ✅
12. **Average extended price ≤ 60,000**: Not directly assessable from aggregated output.
13. **Single extended price ≤ 90,000**: Not directly assessable from aggregated output.
14. **At least one line item**: Result returns a non-null revenue, implying at least one line item. ✅
