For a blacksmithing business, this would be:\n- NOT a direct business expense (not related to metalworking services, equipment, materials, or operations)\n- NOT a necessary business tool (unlike software, equipment, or supplies)\n- Primarily personal entertainment use\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a personal expense with **0% business use**, so business_use_pct = 0.\n\nLet me insert this into the IRS form table:"
